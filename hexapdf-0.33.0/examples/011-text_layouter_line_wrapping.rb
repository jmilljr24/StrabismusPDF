# # Text Layouter - Line Wrapping
#
# The [HexaPDF::Layout::TextLayouter] class can be used to easily lay out text,
# automatically wrapping it appropriately.
#
# Text is broken only at certain characters:
#
# * The most important break points are **spaces**.
#
# * Lines can be broken at **tabulators** which represent eight spaces.
#
# * **Newline characters** are respected when wrapping and introduce a line
#   break. They have to be removed beforehand if this is not wanted. All Unicode
#   newline separators are recognized.
#
# * **Hyphens** are used as break points, possibly breaking just after them.
#
# * In addition to hyphens, **soft-hyphens** can be used to indicate break
#   points. In contrast to hyphens, soft-hyphens won't be visible unless a line
#   is broken at its position.
#
# * **Zero-width spaces** can be used to indicate break points at any position.
#
# * **Non-breaking spaces** can be used to prohibit a break between two words.
#   It has the same appearance as a space in the PDF.
#
# This example shows all these specially handled characters in action, e.g. a
# hard line break after "Fly-fishing", soft-hyphen in "wandering", tabulator
# instead of space after "wandering", zero-width space in "fantastic" and
# non-breaking spaces in "1 0 1".
#
# Usage:
# : `ruby text_layout_line_wrapping.rb`
