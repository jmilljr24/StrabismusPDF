    # An Image box object is used for displaying an image.
    #
    # It can either be used directly or through the HexaPDF::Composer#image method.
    #
    # How an image is displayed inside an image box, depends on whether the +width+ and/or +height+
    # of the box has been set:
    #
    # * If one of them has been set, the other is adjusted to retain the image ratio.
    #
    #     #>pdf-composer100
    #     composer.image(machu_picchu, width: 40)
    #     composer.image(machu_picchu, height: 40)
    #
    # * If both have been set, both are used as is.
    #
    #     #>pdf-composer100
    #     composer.image(machu_picchu, width: 100, height: 30)
    #
    # * If neither has been set, the image is scaled to fit the available space.
