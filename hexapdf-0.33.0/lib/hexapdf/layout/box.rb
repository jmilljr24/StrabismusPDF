  module Layout

    # The base class for all layout boxes.
    #
    # == Box Model
    #
    # HexaPDF uses the following box model:
    #
    # * Each box can specify a width and height. Padding and border are inside, the margin outside
    #   of this rectangle.
    #
    # * The #content_width and #content_height accessors can be used to get the width and height of
    #   the content box without padding and the border.
    #
    # * If width or height is set to zero, they are determined automatically during layouting.
    #
    #
    # == Subclasses
    #
    # Each subclass should only take keyword arguments on initialization so that the boxes can be
    # instantiated from the common convenience method HexaPDF::Document::Layout#box. To use this
    # facility subclasses need to be registered with the configuration option 'layout.boxes.map'.
    #
    # The methods #fit, #supports_position_flow?, #split or #split_content, #empty?, and #draw or
    # #draw_content need to be customized according to the subclass's use case.
    #
    # #fit:: This method should return +true+ if fitting was successful. Additionally, the
    #        @fit_successful instance variable needs to be set to the fit result as it is used in
    #        #split.
    #
    # #supports_position_flow?::
    #        If the subclass supports the value :flow of the 'position' style property, this method
    #        needs to be overridden to return +true+.
    #
    # #split:: This method splits the content so that the available space is used as good as
    #          possible. The default implementation should be fine for most use-cases, so only
    #          #split_content needs to be implemented. The method #create_split_box should be used
    #          for getting a basic cloned box.
    #
    # #empty?:: This method should return +true+ if the subclass won't draw anything when #draw is
    #           called.
    #
    # #draw:: This method draws the content and the default implementation already handles things
    #         like drawing the border and background. Therefore it's best to implement #draw_content
    #         which should just draw the content.
    class Box

      include Geom2D::Utils

      # Creates a new Box object, using the provided block as drawing block (see ::new).
      #
      # If +content_box+ is +true+, the width and height are taken to mean the content width and
      # height and the style's padding and border are added to them appropriately.
      #
      # The +style+ argument defines the Style object (see Style::create for details) for the box.
      # Any additional keyword arguments have to be style properties and are applied to the style
      # object.
