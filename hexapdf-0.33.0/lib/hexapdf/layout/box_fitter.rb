    # A BoxFitter instance contains an array of Frame objects and allows placing boxes one after the
    # other in them. Such functionality is useful, for example, for boxes that provide multiple
    # frames for content.
    #
    # == Usage
    #
    # * First one needs to add the frame objects via #<< or provide them on initialization.
    #
    # * Then use the #fit method to fit boxes one after the other. No drawing is done.
    #
    # * Once all boxes have been fitted, the #fit_results, #remaining_boxes and #fit_successful?
    #   methods can be used to get the result:
    #
    #   - If there are no remaining boxes, all boxes were successfully fitted into the frames.
    #   - If there are remaining boxes but no fit results, the first box could not be fitted.
    #   - If there are remaining boxes and fit results, some boxes were able to fit.
