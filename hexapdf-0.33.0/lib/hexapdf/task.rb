module HexaPDF

  # == Overview
  #
  # The Task module contains task implementations which are used to perform operations that affect
  # a whole PDF document instead of just a single object.
  #
  # Normally, such operations would be implemented by using methods on the HexaPDF::Document class.
  # However, this would clutter up the document interface with various methods and also isn't very
  # extensible.
  #
  # A task name that can be used for HexaPDF::Document#task is mapped to a task object via the
  # 'task.map' configuration option.
  #
  #
  # == Implementing a Task
  #
  # A task is simply a callable object that takes the document as first mandatory argument and can
  # optionally take keyword arguments and/or a block. This means that a block suffices.
  #
  # Here is a simple example:
  #
  #   doc = HexaPDF::Document.new
  #   doc.config['task.map'][:validate] = lambda do |doc|
  #     doc.each {|obj| obj.validate || raise "Invalid object #{obj}"}
  #   end
  module Task

    autoload(:Optimize, 'hexapdf/task/optimize')
    autoload(:Dereference, 'hexapdf/task/dereference')

  end

end
