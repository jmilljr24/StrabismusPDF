    # A TransformationMatrix is a matrix used in PDF graphics operations to specify the
    # relationship between different coordinate systems.
    #
    # All matrix operations modify the matrix in place. So if the original matrix should be
    # preserved, duplicate it before the operation.
    #
    # It is important to note that the matrix transforms from the new coordinate system to the
    # untransformed coordinate system. This means that after the transformation all coordinates
    # are specified in the new, transformed coordinate system and to get the untransformed
    # coordinates the matrix needs to be applied.
    #
    # Although all operations are done in 2D space the transformation matrix is a 3x3 matrix
    # because homogeneous coordinates are used. This, however, also means that only six entries
    # are actually used that are named like in the following graphic:
    #
    #   a b 0
    #   c d 0
    #   e f 1
    #
    # Here is a simple transformation matrix to translate all coordinates by 5 units horizontally
    # and 10 units vertically:
    #
    #   1  0 0
    #   0  1 0
    #   5 10 1
    #
    # Details and some examples can be found in the PDF reference.
    #
    # See: PDF2.0 s8.3
