    # This class provides the basic drawing operations supported by PDF.
    #
    # == General Information
    #
    # A canvas object is used for modifying content streams on a level higher than text. It would
    # be possible to write a content stream by hand since PDF uses a simplified reversed polish
    # notation for specifying operators: First come the operands, then comes the operator and no
    # operator returns any result. However, it is easy to make mistakes this way and one has to
    # know all operators and their operands.
    #
    # This is rather tedious and therefore this class exists. It allows one to modify a content
    # stream by invoking methods that should be familiar to anyone that has ever used a graphics
    # API. There are methods for moving the current point, drawing lines and curves, setting the
    # color, line width and so on.
    #
    # The PDF operators themselves are implemented as classes, see Operator. The canvas class uses
    # the Operator::BaseOperator#invoke and Operator::BaseOperator#serialize methods for applying
    # changes and serialization, with one exception: color setters don't invoke the corresponding
    # operator implementation but work directly on the graphics state.

    # == PDF Graphics
    #
    # === Graphics Operators and Objects
    #
    # There are about 60 PDF content stream operators. Some are used for changing the graphics
    # state, some for drawing paths and others for showing text. This is all abstracted through
    # the Canvas class.
    #
    # PDF knows about five different graphics objects: path objects, text objects, external
    # objects, inline image objects and shading objects. If none of the five graphics objects is
    # current, the content stream is at the so called page description level (in between graphics
    # objects).
    #
    # Additionally the PDF operators are divided into several groups, like path painting or text
    # showing operators, and such groups of operators are allowed to be used only in certain
    # graphics objects or the page description level.
    #
    # Have a look at the PDF specification (PDF2.0 s8.2) for more details.
    #
    # HexaPDF tries to ensure the proper use of the operators and graphics objects and if it
    # cannot do it, an error is raised. So if you don't modify a content stream directly but via
    # the Canvas methods, you generally don't have to worry about the low-level inner workings.
    #
    # === Graphics State
    #
    # Some operators modify the so called graphics state (see GraphicsState). The graphics state is
    # a collection of settings that is used during processing or creating a content stream. For
    # example, the path painting operators don't have operands to specify the line width or the
    # stroke color but take this information from the graphics state.
    #
    # One important thing about the graphics state is that it is only possible to restore a prior
    # state using the save and restore methods. It is not possible to reset the graphics state
    # while creating the content stream!
    #
    # This means, for example, if you use a clipping path (see #clip_path) you should first save the
    # graphics state (#save_graphics_state) and then restore it afterwards
    # (#restore_graphics_state). Otherwise all following operations will be clipped to the clipping
    # path.
    #
    # === Paths
    #
    # A PDF path object consists of one or more subpaths. Each subpath can be a rectangle or can
    # consist of lines and cubic bezier curves. No other types of subpaths are known to PDF.
    # However, the Canvas class contains additional methods that use the basic path construction
    # methods for drawing other paths like circles.
    #
    # When a subpath is started, the current graphics object is changed to :path. After all path
    # constructions are finished, a path painting method needs to be invoked to change back to the
    # page description level. Optionally, the path painting method may be preceeded by a clipping
    # path method to change the current clipping path (see #clip_path).
    #
    # There are four kinds of path painting methods:
    #
    # * Those that stroke the path,
    # * those that fill the path,
    # * those that stroke and fill the path and
    # * one to neither stroke or fill the path (used, for example, to just set the clipping path).
    #
    # In addition filling may be done using either the nonzero winding number rule or the even-odd
    # rule.
    #
    # See: PDF2.0 s8, s9

      # * As does a string in the format "RGB" where "RR", "GG" and "BB" would be used as the
      #   hexadecimal numbers for the red, green and blue color values of an RGB color.
      #
      # * Any other string is treated as a color name. HexaPDF supports CSS Color Module Level 3
      #   color names (see https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-3/#svg-color) as well as HexaPDF design
      #   colors.
      #
      # * Four numeric arguments specify a CMYK color (see ColorSpace::DeviceCMYK::Color).
      #
      # * A color object is used directly (normally used for color spaces other than DeviceRGB,
      #   DeviceCMYK and DeviceGray).
      #
      # * An array is treated as if its items were specified separately as arguments.
      #
