      # This graphic object represents a solid elliptical arc, i.e. an arc that has an inner and
      # an outer set of a/b values.
      #
      # Note that only the path itself is added to the canvas. So depending on the use-case the path
      # itself still has to be, for example, stroked.
      #
      # This graphic object is registered under the :solid_arc key for use with the
      # HexaPDF::Content::Canvas class.
      #
