      # This class provides support for drawing Geom2D objects like line segments and polygons.
      #
      # By default, the paths for the objects are not only added to the canvas but are also stroked
      # or filled (depending on the specific Geom2D object).
      #
      # Supported Geom2D objects are:
      #
      # * Geom2D::Point
      # * Geom2D::Segment
      # * Geom2D::Polygon
      # * Geom2D::PolygonSet
      #
      # Examples:
      #
      #   #>pdf-center
      #   canvas.draw(:geom2d, object: ::Geom2D::Point(-10, 10))
      #   canvas.draw(:geom2d, object: ::Geom2D::Polygon([10, 10], [30, 20], [0, 50]))
      #
      # See: Geom2D - https://github.com/gettalong/geom2d
      class Geom2D

        #
        # This attribute *must* be set before drawing.
        attr_accessor :object

        # The radius to use when drawing Geom2D::Point objects, defaults to 1.
        #
        # Examples:
        #
        #   #>pdf-center
        #   canvas.draw(:geom2d, object: ::Geom2D::Point(0, 0))
        #   canvas.draw(:geom2d, object: ::Geom2D::Point(50, 0), point_radius: 5)
        attr_accessor :point_radius

        # Specifies whether only paths should be drawn or if they should be stroked/filled too
        # (the default).
        #
        # Examples:
        #
        #   #>pdf-center
        #   canvas.draw(:geom2d, object: ::Geom2D::Segment([0, 0], [0, 50]))
        #   canvas.draw(:geom2d, object: ::Geom2D::Segment([0, 0], [50, 0]), path_only: true)
        attr_accessor :path_only

        #
        # :object:: The object that should be drawn. If this argument has not been set before and is
        #           also not given, an error will be raised when calling #draw.
        # :point_radius:: The radius of the points when drawing points.
        # :path_only:: Whether only the path should be drawn.
