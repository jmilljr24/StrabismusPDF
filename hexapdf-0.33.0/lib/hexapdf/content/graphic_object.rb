  module Content

    # == Overview
    #
    # This module contains classes describing graphic objects that can be drawn on a Canvas.
    #
    # Since the PDF specification only provides the most common path creation operators, more
    # complex graphic objects need more than one operator for their creation. By defining this
    # graphic object interface (see below) such complex objects can be drawn in a consistent
    # manner on a Canvas.
    #
    # A graphic object should only use the path creation methods or other graphic objects when it
    # is drawn. Stroking and filling, or optionally clipping, is left to the user.
    #
    # The Canvas class provides a Canvas#draw method that can be used to draw complex graphic
    # objects as well as a Canvas#graphic_object method to retrieve an instance of a graphic object
    # for custom use. The latter method uses graphic object factories that can be registered via a
    # name using the document specific 'graphic_object.map' configuration option.
    #
    # == Implementation of a Graphic Object
    #
    # Graphic objects are usually implemented as classes since this automatically allows using the
    # class itself as the graphic object's factory.
    #
    # A graphic object factory is an object that responds to #configure(**kwargs) and returns a
    # configured graphic object. When the factory is implemented as a class, the #configure method
    # should be a class method returning properly configured instances of the class.
    #
    # A graphic object itself has to respond to two methods:
    #
    # #configure(**kwargs)::
    #     This method is used for re-configuring the graphic object and it should return the
    #     graphic object itself, not a new object.
    #
    # #draw(canvas)::
    #     This method is used for drawing the graphic object on the given Canvas.
