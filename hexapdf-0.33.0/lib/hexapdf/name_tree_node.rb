  # Implementation of PDF name trees.
  #
  # Name trees are used in a similar fashion as dictionaries, however, the key in a name tree is
  # always a string instead of a symbol. Another difference is that the keys in a name tree are
  # always sorted to allow fast lookup of a specific key.
  #
  # A name tree consists of one or more NameTreeNodes. If there is only one node, it contains all
  # stored associations in the /Names entry. Otherwise the root node needs to have a /Kids entry
  # that points to one or more intermediate or leaf nodes. An intermediate node contains a /Kids
  # entry whereas a leaf node contains a /Names entry.
  #
  # Since this is a complex structure that must follow several restrictions, it is not advised to
  # build a name tree manually. Instead, use the provided convenience methods (see
  # HexaPDF::Utils::SortedTreeNode) to add or retrieve entries. They ensure that the name tree stays
  # valid.
  #
  # See: PDF2.0 s7.9.6
