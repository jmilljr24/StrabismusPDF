  # The Importer class manages the process of copying objects from one Document to another.
  #
  # It may seem unnecessary using an importer containing state for the task. However, by retaining
  # some information about the already copied objects we can make sure that already imported
  # objects don't get imported again.
  #
  # Two types of indirect objects are *never* imported from one document to another: the catalog
  # and page tree nodes. If the catalog was imported, the whole source document would be imported.
  # And if one page tree node would imported, the whole page tree would be imported.
  #
  # See: Document#import
