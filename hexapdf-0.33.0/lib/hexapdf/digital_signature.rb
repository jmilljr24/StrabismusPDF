module HexaPDF

  # PDF documents can be signed using digital signatures. Such a signature can be used to
  # authenticate the identity of the signer and the contents of the documents.
  #
  # This module contains all code related to digital signatures in PDF:
  #
  # * Signatures provides the convenience interface accessible via Document#signatures.
  # * Signature implements the PDF signature dictionary.
  # * BaseHandler, CMSHandler and PKCS1Handler are used for verifying existing signatures.
  # * The Signing module implements the functionality for creating digital signatures.
  #
  # See: PDF2.0 s12.8
