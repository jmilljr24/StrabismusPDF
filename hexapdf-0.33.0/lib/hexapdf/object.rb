  # Objects of the PDF object system.
  #
  # == Overview
  #
  # A PDF object is like a normal object but with an additional *object identifier* consisting of
  # an object number and a generation number. If the object number is zero, then the PDF object
  # represents a direct object. Otherwise the object identifier uniquely identifies this object as
  # an indirect object and can be used for referencing it (from possibly multiple places).
  #
  # Furthermore a PDF object may have an associated stream. However, this stream is only
  # accessible if the subclass Stream is used.
  #
  # A PDF object *should* be connected to a PDF document, otherwise some methods may not work.
  #
  # Most PDF objects in a PDF document are represented by subclasses of this class that provide
  # additional functionality.
  #
  # The methods #hash and #eql? are implemented so that objects of this class can be used as hash
  # keys. Furthermore the implementation is compatible to the one of Reference, i.e. the hash of a
  # PDF Object is the same as the hash of its corresponding Reference object.
  #
  # == Allowed PDF Object Values
  #
  # The PDF specification knows of the following object types:
  #
  # * Boolean (mapped to +true+ and +false+),
  # * Integer (mapped to Integer object)
  # * Real (mapped to Float objects)
  # * String (mapped to String objects with UTF-8 or binary encoding)
  # * Names (mapped to Symbol objects)
  # * Array (mapped to Array objects)
  # * Dictionary (mapped to Hash objects)
  # * Stream (mapped to the Stream class which is a Dictionary with the associated stream data)
  # * Null (mapped to +nil+)
  # * Indirect Object (mapped to this class)
  #
  # So working with PDF objects in HexaPDF is rather straightforward since the common Ruby objects
  # can be used for most things, i.e. wrapping an plain Ruby object into an object of this class is
  # not necessary (except if it should become an indirect object).
  #
  # There are also some additional data structures built from these primitive ones. For example,
  # Time objects are represented as specially formatted string objects and conversion from and to
  # the string representation is handled automatically.
  #
  # *Important*: Users of HexaPDF may use other plain Ruby objects but then there is no guarantee
  # that everything will work correctly, especially when using other collection types than arrays
  # and hashes.

    # == Implementation Hint for Subclasses
    #
    # A subclass needs to call the super method so that the validation routines of the superclasses
    # are also performed!
    #
    # When the validation routine finds that the object is invalid, it has to yield a problem
    # description and whether the problem can be corrected. An optional third argument may contain
    # the object that gets validated if it is different from this object (may happen when
    # auto-correction is used).
    #
    # After yielding, the problem has to be corrected if it is correctable. If it is not correctable
    # and not correcting would lead to exceptions the method has to return early.
    #
    # Here is a sample validation routine for a dictionary object type:
    #
    #   def perform_validation
    #     super
    #
    #     if value[:SomeKey].length != 7
    #       yield("Length of /SomeKey is invalid")
    #       # No need to return early here because following check doesn't rely on /SomeKey
    #     end
    #
    #     if value[:OtherKey] % 2 == 0
    #       yield("/OtherKey needs to contain an odd number of elements")
    #     end
    #   end
    def perform_validation(&block)
