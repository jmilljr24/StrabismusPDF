    # This class provides methods for managing the images embedded in a PDF file. It is available
    # through the HexaPDF::Document#images method.
    #
    # Images themselves are represented by the HexaPDF::Type::Image class.Since an image can be used
    # as a mask for another image, not all image objects found in a PDF are really used as images.
    # Such cases are all handled by this class automatically.
