module HexaPDF
  class Document

    # This class provides methods for managing file specifications of a PDF file.
    #
    # Note that for a given PDF file not all file specifications may be found, e.g. when a file
    # specification is only a string. Therefore this module can only handle those file
    # specifications that are indirect file specification dictionaries with the /Type key set.
    class Files

      include Enumerable

      # Creates a new Files object for the given PDF document.
      def initialize(document)

      #   files.add(io, name:, description: nil)                        -> file_spec
      #
      # Adds the file or IO to the PDF document and returns the corresponding file specification
      # object.
      #
      # Options:
      #
      # name::
      #     The name that should be used for the file path. This name is also used for registering
      #     the file in the EmbeddedFiles name tree.
      #
      #     When a filename is given, the basename of the file is used by default for +name+ if it
      #     is not specified.
      #
      # description::
      #     A description of the file.
      #
      # embed::
      #     When an IO object is given, it is always embedded and this option is ignored.
      #
      #     When a filename is given and this option is +true+, then the file is embedded. Otherwise
      #     only a reference to it is stored.
