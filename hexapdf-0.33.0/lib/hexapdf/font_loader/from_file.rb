module HexaPDF
  module FontLoader

    # This module interprets the font name either as file name and tries to load it, or as TrueType
    # font object to be wrapped directly.
    module FromFile

      # :call-seq:
      #   FromFile.call(document, file_name, subset: true, **)           -> wrapped_font
      #   FromFile.call(document, font_object, subset: true, **)    -> wrapped_font
      #
      # Returns an appropriate font wrapper for the given file name or TrueType font object.
      #
      # If a file name is given, the file object representing the font file is *not* closed and if
      # needed must be closed by the caller once the font is not needed anymore.
      #
      # The first form using a file name is easier to use in one-off cases. However, if multiple
      # documents always refer to the same font, the second form is better to avoid re-parsing the
      # font file.

      #     The PDF document to associate the font wrapper with.

      #     The file name or a HexaPDF::Font::TrueType::Font object.
      #
      # +subset+::
      #     Specifies whether the font should be subset if possible.
