      # Provides access to and mapping functionality for the Adobe Glyph List.
      #
      # The Adobe Glyph List is used for mapping glyph names to Unicode values. The mapping itself
      # is not a one-to-one mapping because some glyphs are mapped to the same Unicode sequence,
      # e.g. the glyph name for 'A' and the glyph name for 'small capital A'.
      #
      # Since a reverse mapping is needed for converting UTF-8 strings to glyph names when encoding
      # text, this (not unique) reverse mapping is also available. However, only the first occurence
      # of a particular Unicode string is reverse-mapped.
      #
