module HexaPDF

  # Manages the indirect objects of one cross-reference section or stream.
  #
  # A PDF file can have more than one cross-reference section or stream which are all
  # daisy-chained together. This allows later sections to override entries in prior ones. This is
  # automatically and transparently done by HexaPDF.
  #
  # Note that a cross-reference section may contain a single object number only once.
  #
  # See: HexaPDF::Revision, PDF2.0 s7.5.4, s7.5.8
  class XRefSection < Utils::ObjectHash

    # One entry of a cross-reference section or stream.
    #
    # An entry has the attributes +type+, +oid+, +gen+, +pos+ and +objstm+ and can be created like
    # this:
    #
    #   Entry.new(type, oid, gen, pos, objstm)   -> entry
    #
    # The +type+ attribute can be:
    #
    # :free:: Denotes a free entry.
    #
    # :in_use:: A used entry that resides in the body of the PDF file. The +pos+ attribute defines
    #           the position in the file at which the object can be found.
    #
    # :compressed:: A used entry that resides in an object stream. The +objstm+ attribute contains
    #               the reference to the object stream in which the object can be found and the
    #               +pos+ attribute contains the index into the object stream.
    #
    #               Objects in an object stream always have a generation number of 0!
    #
    # See: PDF2.0 s7.5.4, s7.5.8
