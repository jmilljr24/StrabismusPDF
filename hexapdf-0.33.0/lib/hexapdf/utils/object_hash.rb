    # There are some structures in a PDF file, for example cross reference tables, that index data
    # based on object and generation numbers. However, there is a restriction that in such
    # structures the object numbers must be unique, e.g. there may not be entries for [1, 0] and
    # \[1, 1] at the same time.

    # This class can be used for storing/retrieving data for such structures.
