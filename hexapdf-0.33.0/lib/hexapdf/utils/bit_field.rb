module HexaPDF
  module Utils

    # This module is intended to be used to extend class objects. It provides the method #bit_field
    # for declaring a bit field.
    module BitField

      # Creates a bit field for managing the integer attribute +name+.
      #
      # The +mapping+ argument specifies the mapping of names to zero-based bit indices which allows
      # one to use either the bit name or its index when getting or setting. When using an unknown
      # bit name or bit index, an error is raised.
      #
      # The calling class needs to respond to \#name and \#name= because these methods are used to
      # get and set the raw integer value; or provide custom method names using the +value_getter+
      # and +value_setter+ arguments.
      #
      # After invoking the method the calling class has four new instance methods:
      #
      # * NAME_values which returns an array of bit names representing the set bits.
      # * NAME_include?(bit) which returns true if the given bit is set.
      # * set_NAME(*bits, clear_existing: false) for setting the given bits.
      # * unset_NAME(*bits) for clearing the given bits.
      #
      # The method names can be overridden using the arguments +lister+, +getter+, +setter+ and
      # +unsetter+.
