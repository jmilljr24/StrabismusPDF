  # A reference to an indirect object.
  #
  # The PDF syntax allows for references to existing and non-existing indirect objects. Such
  # references are represented with objects of this class.
  #
  # Note that after initialization changing the object or generation numbers is not possible
  # anymore!
  #
  # The methods #hash and #eql? are implemented so that objects of this class can be used as hash
  # keys. Furthermore the implementation is compatible to the one of Object, i.e. the hash of a
  # Reference object is the same as the hash of an indirect Object.
  #
  # See: PDF2.0 s7.3.10, Object
  class Reference

    # keys and can be compared.
