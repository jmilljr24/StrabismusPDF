module HexaPDF

  # == Overview
  #
  # A *font loader* is a callable object that loads a font based on the given name and options. If
  # the font loader doesn't have the requested font, it has to return +nil+.
  #
  # The returned object has to be a PDF font wrapper and not the generic font object because it
  # needs to be usable by the PDF canvas. See below for details.
  #
  #
  # == Implementation of a Font Loader
  #
  # Each font loader is a (stateless) object (normally a module) that has to be callable, i.e. it
  # has to provide the following method:
  #
  # call(document, name, **options)::
  #     Should return the font wrapper customized for the given document if the font is known or
  #     else +nil+.
  #
  # The +options+ argument is font loader dependent. However, all font loaders should handle the
  # following common options:
  #
  # variant:: The font variant that should be used (e.g. +:none+, +:bold+, +:italic+,
  #           +:bold_italic+).
  #
  # Optionally, a font loader can provide a method +available_fonts(document)+ that returns a hash
  # where the keys are the font names and the values are the variants of all the provided fonts.
  #
  #
  # == Font Wrappers
  #
  # A font wrapper needs to provide the following generic interface so that it can be used correctly
  # by HexaPDF:
  #
  # dict::
  #     This method needs to return the PDF font dictionary that represents the wrapped font.
  #
  # decode_utf8(str)::
  #     This method needs to convert the given string into an array of glyph objects. The glyph
  #     objects themselves have to respond to \#width which should return their horizontal width.
  #
  # encode(glyph)::
  #     This method takes a single glyph object, that needs to be compatible with the font wrapper,
  #     and returns an encoded string that can be decoded with the font dictionary returned by
  #     \#dict.
  #
  # HexaPDF contains a font wrapper implementation for the Standard 14 PDF fonts (see
  # HexaPDF::Font::Type1Wrapper) and one for TrueType fonts (see HexaPDF::Font::TrueTypeWrapper).
