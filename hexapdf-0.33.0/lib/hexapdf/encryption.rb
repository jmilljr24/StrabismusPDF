module HexaPDF

  # == Overview
  #
  # A PDF document may be encrypted so that
  #
  # * certain permissions are respected when the document is opened,
  # * a password must be specified so that a document can be openend, or so that
  # * a password must be specified to remove the restrictions and allow full access.
  #
  # This module contains all encryption and security related code to facilitate PDF encryption.
  #
  #
  # === Security Handlers
  #
  # Security handlers manage the process of encrypting and decrypting a PDF document. One of the
  # main responsibilities of them is providing the encryption key that is then used by the
  # selected encryption algorithm (see below). However, security handlers may also provide
  # additional information.
  #
  # The Encryption::SecurityHandler is the base class for all such security handlers. It defines the
  # interface and all common code for encrypting and decrypting strings and streams.
  #
  # The PDF specification also defines a password-based standard security handler that
  # additionally allows setting permission information. This security handler is implemented by
  # the Encryption::StandardSecurityHandler class.
  #
  # There is also a certificate-based security handler defined by the PDF specification. However,
  # that handler is not implemented.
  #
  #
  # === Encryption Algorithms
  #
  # PDF security is based on two algorithms with varying key lengths: ARC4 and AES. The ARC4 and
  # AES modules contain code common to their specific algorithm and are adapted to work together
  # with any SecurityHandler.
  #
  # There are at least two versions of each algorithm present:
  #
  # FastAES and FastARC4::
  #   The preferred versions which are based on OpenSSL and therefore rely on the OpenSSL library
  #   and a C extension.
  #
  # RubyAES and RubyARC4::
  #   Pure Ruby implementations of the algorithms which are naturally much slower than the OpenSSL
  #   based ones. However, these implementation can be used on any Ruby implementation.
  #
  # The ARC4 algorithm is deprecated with PDF 2.0 and should not be used when creating new
  # documents.
  #
  # See: PDF2.0 s7.6
