    # that is embedded into the PDF file. Each embedded file is either associated with a certain
    # Type::FileSpecification dictionary or with the document as a whole through the /EmbeddedFiles
    # entry in the document catalog's /Names dictionary.

    # See: PDF2.0 s7.11.4, FileSpecification
