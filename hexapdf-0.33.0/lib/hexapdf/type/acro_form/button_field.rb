      # AcroForm button fields represent interactive controls to be used with the mouse.
      #
      # They are divided into push buttons (things to click on), check boxes and radio buttons. All
      # of these are represented with this class.
      #
      # To create a push button, check box or radio button field, use the appropriate convenience
      # methods on the main Form instance (HexaPDF::Document#acro_form). By using those methods,
      # everything needed is automatically set up.
      #
      # Radio buttons are widgets of a single radio button field. This is also called a radio button
      # group. Of the radio button group only one radio button (= widget of the radio button field)
      # may be selected at all times. Each widget must have a different value to be distinguishable;
      # otherwise the widgets with the same value represent the same thing. Although there is the
      # +no_toggle_to_off+ field flag, no PDF viewer implements that; one needs to use check boxes
      # for this feature.
      #
      # Check boxes can be toggled on and off. One check box field may have multiple widgets. If
      # those widgets have the same value, they will all be toggled on or off simultaneously.
      # Otherwise only one of those widgets will be toggled on while the others are off. In such a
      # case the check box fields acts like a radio button group, with the additional feature that
      # no check box may be selected.
      #
      # == Type Specific Field Flags
      #
      # :no_toggle_to_off:: Only used with radio buttons fields. If this flag is set, one button
      #                     needs to be selected at all times. Otherwise, clicking on the selected
      #                     button deselects it.
      #
      #                     Note: This deselectiong is not implemented in *any* tested PDF viewer. A
      #                     work-around is to use multiple check box widgets with different on
      #                     names.
      #
      # :radio:: If this flag is set, the field is a set of radio buttons. Otherwise it is a check
      #          box. Additionally, the :pushbutton flag needs to be clear.
      #
      # :push_button:: The field represents a pushbutton without a permanent value.
      #
      # :radios_in_unison:: A group of radio buttons with the same value for the on state will turn
      #                     on or off in unison.
      #
