      # AcroForm choice fields contain multiple text items of which one (or, if so flagged, more)
      # may be selected.
      #
      # They are divided into scrollable list boxes and combo boxes. To create a list or combo box,
      # use the appropriate convenience methods on the main Form instance
      # (HexaPDF::Document#acro_form). By using those methods, everything needed is automatically
      # set up.
      #
      # == Type Specific Field Flags
      #
      # :combo:: If set, the field represents a comb box.
      #
      # :edit:: If set, the combo box includes an editable text box for entering arbitrary values.
      #         Therefore the 'combo' flag also needs to be set.
      #
      # :sort:: The option items have to be sorted alphabetically. This flag is intended for PDF
      #         writers, not readers which should display the items in the order they appear.
      #
      # :multi_select:: If set, more than one item may be selected.
      #
      # :do_not_spell_check:: The text should not be spell-checked.
      #
      # :commit_on_sel_change:: If set, a new value should be commited as soon as a selection is
      #                         made.
      #
