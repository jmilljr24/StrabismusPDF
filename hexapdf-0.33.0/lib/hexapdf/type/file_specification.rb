module HexaPDF
  module Type

    # Represents a file specification dictionary.
    #
    # File specifications are used to refer to other files or URLs from within a PDF file. Simple
    # file specifications are just strings. However, the are automatically converted on access to
    # a full file specification to provide a unified interface.
    #
    # == Working with File Specifications
    #
    # A file specification may refer to a file or an URL. This can easily be checked with #url?.
    # Independent of whether the file specification referes to an URL or a file, the #path method
    # returns the "best" useable path for it.
    #
    # Modifying a file specification should be done via the #path= and #url= methods as they
    # ensure that no obsolescent entries are used and the file specification is consistent.
    #
    # Finally, since embedded files in a PDF document are always linked to a file specification it
    # is useful to provide embedding/unembedding operations in this class, see #embed and
    # #unembed.
    #
    # See: PDF2.0 s7.11
