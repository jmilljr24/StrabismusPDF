    # Represents PDF type ObjStm, object streams.
    #
    # An object stream is a stream that can hold multiple indirect objects. Since the objects are
    # stored inside the stream, filters can be used to compress the stream content and therefore
    # represent the indirect objects more compactly than would be possible otherwise.
    #
    # == How are Object Streams Used?
    #
    # When an indirect object that resides in an object stream needs to be loaded, the object stream
    # itself is parsed and loaded and #parse_stream is invoked to get an ObjectStream::Data object
    # representing the stored indirect objects. After that the requested indirect object itself is
    # loaded and returned using this ObjectStream::Data object. From a user's perspective nothing
    # changes when an object is located inside an object stream instead of directly in a PDF file.
    #
    # The indirect objects initially stored in the object stream are automatically added to the
    # list of to-be-stored objects when #parse_stream is invoked. Additional objects can be
    # assigned to the object stream via #add_object or deleted from it via #delete_object.
    #
    # Before an object stream is written, it is necessary to invoke #write_objects so that the
    # to-be-stored objects are serialized to the stream. This is automatically done by the Writer.
    # A user thus only has to define which objects should reside in the object stream.
    #
    # However, only objects that can be written to the object stream are actually written. The
    # other objects are deleted from the object stream (#delete_object) and written normally.
    #
    # See PDF2.0 s7.5.7
