    # Represents PDF type XRef, cross-reference streams.
    #
    # A cross-reference stream is used as a more compact representation for an cross-reference
    # section and trailer dictionary. The trailer dictionary is incorporated into the stream
    # dictionary and the cross-reference section entries are stored in the stream itself,
    # compressed to save space.
    #
    # == How are Cross-reference Streams Used?
    #
    # Cross-reference stream objects are only used when parsing or writing a PDF document.
    #
    # When a file is read and a cross-reference stream is found, it is loaded and its information is
    # stored in a HexaPDF::Revision object. So from a user's perspective nothing changes when a
    # cross-reference stream instead of a cross-reference section and trailer is encountered.
    #
    # This also means that all information stored in a cross-reference stream between parsing and
    # writing is discarded when the PDF document gets written!
    #
    # Upon writing a revision it is checked whether that revision contains a cross-reference
    # stream object. If it does the cross-reference stream object is updated with the
    # cross-reference section and trailer information and then written. Otherwise a normal
    # cross-reference section plus trailer are written.
    #
    # See: PDF2.0 s7.5.8
