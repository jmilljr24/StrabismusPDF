      # Adds a signature to the document and returns the corresponding signature object.
      #
      # This method will add a new signature to the document and write the updated document to the
      # given file or IO stream. Afterwards the document can't be modified anymore and still retain
      # a correct digital signature. To modify the signed document (e.g. for adding another
      # signature) create a new document based on the given file or IO stream instead.
      #
      # +signature+::
      #     Can either be a signature object (determined via the /Type key), a signature field or
      #     +nil+. Providing a signature object or signature field provides for more control, e.g.:
      #
      #     * Setting values for optional signature object fields like /Reason and /Location.
      #     * (In)directly specifying which signature field should be used.
      #
      #     If a signature object is provided and it is not associated with an AcroForm signature
      #     field, a new signature field is created and added to the main AcroForm object, creating
      #     that if necessary.
      #
      #     If a signature field is provided and it already has a signature object as field value,
      #     that signature object is discarded.
      #
      #     If the signature field doesn't have a widget, a non-visible one is created on the first
      #     page.
      #
      # +handler+::
      #     The signing handler that provides the necessary methods for signing and adjusting the
      #     signature and signature field objects to one's liking, see #signing_handler and
      #     Signing::DefaultHandler.
      #
      # +write_options+::
      #     The key-value pairs of this hash will be passed on to the HexaPDF::Document#write
      #     method. Note that +incremental+ will be automatically set to ensure proper behaviour.
