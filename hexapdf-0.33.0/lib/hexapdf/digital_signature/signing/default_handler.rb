    module Signing

      # This is the default signing handler which provides the ability to sign a document with the
      # adbe.pkcs7.detached or ETSI.CAdES.detached algorithms. It is registered under the :default
      # name.
      #
      # == Usage
      #
      # The signing handler is used by default by all methods that need a signing handler. Therefore
      # it is usually only necessary to provide the actual attribute values.
      #
      # *Note*: Currently only RSA is supported, DSA and ECDSA are not. See the examples below for
      # how to handle them using external signing.
      #
      #
      # == CMS and PAdES Signatures
      #
      # The handler supports the older standard of CMS signatures as well as the newer PAdES
      # signatures specified in PDF 2.0. By default, CMS signatures are created but this can be
      # changed by setting #signature_type to :pades.
      #
      # When creating PAdES signatures the following two PAdES baseline signatures are supported:
      # B-B and B-T. The difference between those two is that a timestamp handler was defined for
      # B-T compatibility.
      #
      #
      # == Signing Modes - Internal, External, External/Asynchronous
      #
      # This handler provides two ways to create the CMS signed-data structure required by
      # Signatures#add:
      #
      # * By providing the signing certificate together with the signing key and the certificate
      #   chain, HexaPDF itself does the signing *internally*. It is the preferred way if all the
      #   needed information is available.
      #
      #   Assign the respective data to the #certificate, #key and #certificate_chain attributes.
      #
      # * By using an *external signing mechanism*, a callable object assigned to #external_signing.
      #   Here the actual signing happens "outside" of HexaPDF, for example, in custom code or even
      #   asynchronously. This is needed in case the signing key is not directly available but only
      #   an interface to it (e.g. when dealing with a HSM).
      #
      #   Depending on whether #certificate is set the signing happens differently:
      #
      #   * If #certificate is not set, the callable object is used instead of #sign, so it needs to
      #     accept the same arguments as #sign and needs to return a complete, DER-serialized CMS
      #     signed data object.
      #
      #   * If #certificate is set, the CMS signed data object is created by HexaPDF. The
      #     callable #external_signing object is called with the used digest algorithm and the
      #     already digested data which needs to be signed (but *not* digested) and the signature
      #     returned.
      #
      #   If the signing process needs to be *asynchronous*, make sure to set the #signature_size
      #   appropriately, return an empty string during signing and later use
      #   Signatures.embed_signature to embed the actual signature.
      #
      #
      # == Optional Data
      #
      # Besides the required data, some optional attributes can also be specified:
      #
      # * Reason, location and contact information
      # * Making the signature a certification signature by applying the DocMDP transform method and
      #   a DoCMDP permission
      #
      #
      # == Examples
      #
      #   # Signing using certificate + key
      #   document.sign("output.pdf", certificate: my_cert, key: my_key,
      #                 certificate_chain: my_chain)
      #
      #   # Signing using an external mechanism without certificate set
      #   signing_proc = lambda do |io, byte_range|
      #     io.pos = byte_range[0]
      #     data = io.read(byte_range[1])
      #     io.pos = byte_range[2]
      #     data << io.read(byte_range[3])
      #     signing_service.pkcs7_sign(data).to_der
      #   end
      #   document.sign("output.pdf", signature_size: 10_000, external_signing: signing_proc)
      #
      #   # Signing using external mechanism with certificate set
      #   signing_proc = lambda do |digest_method, hash|
      #     signing_service.sign_raw(digest_method, hash)
      #   end
      #   document.sign("output.pdf", certificate: my_cert, certificate_chain: my_chain,
      #                 external_signing: signing_proc)
      #
      #   # Signing with DSA or ECDSA certificate/keys
      #   signing_proc = lambda do |io, byte_range|
      #     io.pos = byte_range[0]
      #     data = io.read(byte_range[1])
      #     io.pos = byte_range[2]
      #     data << io.read(byte_range[3])
      #     OpenSSL::PKCS7.sign(certificate, key, data, certificate_chain,
      #                         OpenSSL::PKCS7::DETACHED | OpenSSL::PKCS7::BINARY).to_der
      #   end
      #   document.sign("output.pdf", signature_size: 10_000, external_signing: signing_proc)

      # == Implementing a Signing Handler
      #
      # This class also serves as an example on how to create a custom handler: The public methods
      # #signature_size, #finalize_objects and #sign are used by the digital signature algorithm.
      # See their descriptions for details.
      #
      # Once a custom signing handler has been created, it can be registered under the
      # 'signature.signing_handler' configuration option for easy use. It has to take keyword
      # arguments in its initialize method to be compatible with the Signatures#handler method.
      class DefaultHandler

        # The certificate with which to sign the PDF.
        #
        # If the certificate is provided, HexaPDF creates the signature object. Otherwise the
        # #external_signing callable object has to create it.
        #
        # See the class documentation section "Signing Modes" on how #certificate, #key and
        # #external_signing play together.
        attr_accessor :certificate

        # The private key for the #certificate.
        #
        # If the key is provided, HexaPDF does the signing. Otherwise the #external_signing callable
        # object has to sign the data.
        #
        # See the class documentation section "Signing Modes" on how #certificate, #key and
        # #external_signing play together.
        attr_accessor :key

        # The certificate chain that should be embedded in the PDF; usually contains all
        # certificates up to the root certificate.
        attr_accessor :certificate_chain

        # The digest algorithm that should be used when creating the signature.
        #
        # See SignedDataCreator#digest_algorithm for the default value (if nothing is set) and for
        # the allowed values.
        attr_accessor :digest_algorithm

        # The timestamp handler that should be used for timestamping the signature.
        #
        # If this attribute is set, a timestamp token is embedded into the CMS object.
        attr_accessor :timestamp_handler

        # A callable object for custom signing mechanisms.
        #
        # The callable object has two different uses depending on whether #certificate is set:
        #
        # * If #certificate is not set, it fulfills the same role as the #sign method and needs to
        #   conform to that interface.
        #
        # * If #certificate is set and #key is not, it is just used for signing. Here it needs to
        #   accept the used digest algorithm and the already digested data as arguments and return
        #   the signature.
        #
        # Also dee the class documentation section "Signing Modes" on how #certificate, #key and
        # #external_signing play together.
        attr_accessor :external_signing

        # The reason for signing. If used, will be set on the signature dictionary.

        # The size of the serialized signature that should be reserved.
        #
        # If this attribute is not set, an empty string will be signed using #sign to determine the
        # signature size.

        # The size needs to be at least as big as the final signature, otherwise signing results in
        # an error.

        # The type of signature to be written (i.e. the value of the /SubFilter key).

        # (uses an ETSI CAdES compatible signature).
