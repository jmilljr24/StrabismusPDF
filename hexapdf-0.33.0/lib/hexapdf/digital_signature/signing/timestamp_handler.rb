    module Signing

      # This is a signing handler for adding a timestamp signature (a PDF2.0 feature) to a PDF
      # document. It is registered under the :timestamp name.
      #
      # The timestamp is provided by a timestamp authority and establishes the document contents at
      # the time indicated in the timestamp. Timestamping a PDF document is usually done in context
      # of long term validation but can also be done standalone.
      #
      # == Usage
      #
      # It is necessary to provide at least the URL of the timestamp authority server (TSA) via
      # #tsa_url, everything else is optional and uses default values. The TSA server must not use
      # authentication to be usable.
      #
      # Example:
      #
      #   document.sign("output.pdf", handler: :timestamp, tsa_url: 'https://freetsa.org/tsr')
      class TimestampHandler

        # The URL of the timestamp authority server.
        #
        # This value is required.
        attr_accessor :tsa_url

        # The hash algorithm to use for timestamping. Defaults to SHA512.
        attr_accessor :tsa_hash_algorithm

        # The policy OID to use for timestamping. Defaults to +nil+.
        attr_accessor :tsa_policy_id

        # The size of the serialized signature that should be reserved.
        #
        # If this attribute has not been set, an empty string will be signed using #sign to
        # determine the signature size. Note thtat this will contact the TSA server!
        #
        # The size needs to be at least as big as the final signature, otherwise signing results in
        # an error.
        attr_writer :signature_size

        # The reason for timestamping. If used, will be set on the signature dictionary.
        attr_accessor :reason

        # The timestamping location. If used, will be set on the signature dictionary.
        attr_accessor :location

        # The contact information. If used, will be set on the signature dictionary.
        attr_accessor :contact_info
