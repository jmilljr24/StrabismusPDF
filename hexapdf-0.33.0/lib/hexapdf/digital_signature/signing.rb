  module DigitalSignature

    # This module contains everything related to the signing of a PDF document, i.e. signing
    # handlers and the actual code for signing.
    #
    # * The DefaultHandler is the standard signing handler and should be sufficient for most cases.
    # * The TimestampHandler is used for timestamping purposes.
    # * The SignedDataCreator provides the functionality to create custom CMS signed data objects.

      # the PDF document given by the +io+ argument.
      #
      # This functionality can be used together with the support for external signing (see
      # DefaultHandler and DefaultHandler#external_signing) to implement asynchronous signing.

      # Note: This will, most probably, only work on documents prepared for external signing by
      # HexaPDF and not by other libraries.
