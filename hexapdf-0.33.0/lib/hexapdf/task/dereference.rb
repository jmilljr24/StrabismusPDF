module HexaPDF
  module Task

    # Task for recursively dereferencing a single object or the reachable parts of the whole PDF
    # document. Dereferencing means that the references are replaced with the actual objects.
    #
    # Running this task is most often done to prepare for other steps in a PDF transformation
    # process.
    class Dereference

      # Recursively dereferences the reachable parts of the document and returns an array of
      # objects that are never referenced. This includes indirect objects that are used as values
      # for the /Length entry of a stream.
      #
      # If the optional argument +object+ is provided, only the given object is dereferenced and
      # nothing is returned.
