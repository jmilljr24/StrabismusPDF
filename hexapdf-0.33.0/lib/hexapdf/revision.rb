  # Embodies one revision of a PDF file, either the initial version or an incremental update.
  #
  # The purpose of a Revision object is to manage the objects and the trailer of one revision.
  # These objects can either be added manually or loaded from a cross-reference section or stream.
  # Since a PDF file can be incrementally updated, it can have multiple revisions.
  #
  # If a revision doesn't have an associated cross-reference section, it wasn't created from a PDF
  # file.
