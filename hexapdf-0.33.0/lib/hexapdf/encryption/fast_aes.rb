    # Implementation of the general encryption algorithm AES using OpenSSL as backend.
    #
    # Since OpenSSL is a native Ruby extension (that comes bundled with Ruby) it is much faster
    # than the pure Ruby version and it can use the AES-NI instruction set on CPUs when available.
    #
    # This implementation is using AES in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode.
    #
    # See: PDF2.0 s7.6.3
