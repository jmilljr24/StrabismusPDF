    # Base class for all security handlers.
    #
    # == Creating SecurityHandler Instances
    #
    # The base class provides two class methods for this:
    #
    # * The method ::set_up_encryption is used when a security handler instance should be created
    #   that populates the document's encryption dictionary.
    #
    # * The method ::set_up_decryption is used when a security handler should be created from the
    #   document's encryption dictionary.
    #
    # It is *not* recommended to create security handlers manually but only with those two methods
    # listed above.
    #
    #
    # == Using SecurityHandler Instances
    #
    # The SecurityHandler base class provides the methods for decrypting an indirect object and for
    # encrypting strings and streams:
    #
    # * #decrypt
    # * #encrypt_string
    # * #encrypt_stream
    #
    # How the decryption/encryption key is actually computed is deferred to a sub class, as per the
    # PDF specification.
    #
    # Additionally, the #encryption_key_valid? method can be used to check whether the
    # SecurityHandler instance is built from/built for the current version of the encryption
    # dictionary.
    #
    # Note that any manual changes to the encryption dictionary will invalidate the key and lead to
    # an error!
    #
    #
    # == Implementing a SecurityHandler Class
    #
    # Each security handler has to implement the following methods:
    #
    # prepare_encryption(**options)::
    #   Prepares the security handler for use in encrypting the document.
    #
    #   See the #set_up_encryption documentation for information on which options are passed on to
    #   this method.
    #
    #   Returns the encryption key as well as the names of the string, stream and embedded file
    #   algorithms.
    #
    # prepare_decryption(**options)::
    #   Prepares the security handler for decryption by using the information from the document's
    #   encryption dictionary as well as the provided arguments.
    #
    #   See the #set_up_decryption documentation for additional information.
    #
    #   Returns the encryption key that should be used for decryption.
    #
    # Additionally, the following methods can be overridden to provide a more specific meaning:
    #
    # encryption_dictionary_class::
    #   Returns the class that is used for the encryption dictionary. Should be derived from the
    #   EncryptionDictionary class.
    class SecurityHandler

      # Provides additional encryption specific information for HexaPDF::StreamData objects.
