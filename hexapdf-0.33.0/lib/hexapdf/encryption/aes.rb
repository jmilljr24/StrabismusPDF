  module Encryption

    # Common interface for AES algorithms
    #
    # This module defines the common interface that is used by the security handlers to encrypt or
    # decrypt data with AES. It has to be *prepended* by any specific AES algorithm class.
    #
    # See the ClassMethods module for available class level methods of AES algorithms.
    #
    # == Implementing an AES Class
    #
    # An AES class needs to define at least the following methods:
    #
    # initialize(key, iv, mode)::
    #   Initializes the AES algorithm with the given key and initialization vector. The mode
    #   determines how the AES algorithm object works: If the mode is :encrypt, the object
    #   encrypts the data, if the mode is :decrypt, the object decrypts the data.
    #
    # process(data)::
    #   Processes the data and returns the encrypted/decrypted data. The method can assume that
    #   the passed in data always has a length that is a multiple of BLOCK_SIZE.
    module AES

      # Valid AES key lengths
      VALID_KEY_LENGTH = [16, 24, 32].freeze

      # The AES block size
      BLOCK_SIZE = 16

      # Convenience methods for decryption and encryption that operate according to the PDF
      # specification.
      #
      # These methods will be available on the class object that prepends the AES module.
      module ClassMethods

        # Encrypts the given +data+ using the +key+ and a randomly generated initialization
        # vector.
